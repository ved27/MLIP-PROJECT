## Installation

To install Python dependencies and modules, use <br>
```pip install -r requirements.txt``` <br>

- Choose your environment on the website and install [PyTorch](http://pytorch.org/) by running the appropriate command.
- Clone this repository.
- Install one of Python 3+.
- Then download the dataset by following the [instructions](#datasets) below.

## Datasets

In this project we are using the `2007 and 2012 VOC trainval` dataset in order to train the model. Testing the model is implemented using `2007 VOC test` dataset. You can download the dataset by clicking on the following links. 

[2007 Dataset](http://host.robots.ox.ac.uk/pascal/VOC/voc2007/VOCtrainval_06-Nov-2007.tar)


[2012 Dataset](http://host.robots.ox.ac.uk/pascal/VOC/voc2012/VOCtrainval_11-May-2012.tar) 

### Demo
(((NEEDS CHANGES)))
Run **SSD_Demo.ipynb** notebook to run Single-Shot Detection on a random image from the VOC2007 dataset. 

Update ` voc_root ` and ` dataset_root ` in config_vgg16_ssd.py with the location of your downloaded dataset.
`voc_root` -> should contain VOC2007 and VOC2012 directories -> ` PATH_TO/ ` 
and 
`dataset_root ` -> `PATH_TO/VOC2007/` 
### Training
Run **SSD_train.ipynb** notebook to train the SSD model on the PascalVOC2012+07 dataset.
### Evaluation
Run **SSD_Eval.ipynb** notebook to evaluate the SSD model on the VOC2007 test set.

Run **SSD_Eval_Testset.ipynb** notebook to evaluate the SSD model on the PascalVOC2007 test set. (Download the PascalVOC2007 test set using `wget http://pjreddie.com/media/files/VOCtest_06-Nov-2007.tar` and run `tar -xvf VOCtest_06-Nov-2007.tar` in the root directory of the repository.
### Performance 


| Category  | Clean Image (mAP) | Noisy Image (mAP) | Denoised Image (mAP) |
| ------------- | ------------- | ------------- | ------------- |
| Training  |  88.19% | 52.73% | 73.78% | 
| Evaluation  | 77.43% | 46.47% | 61.84% |

### Experiments
- **Training & Optimization Experiments** (Plots for all these experiments can be found inside `optimization_experiments/` folder). The experiemt was run over multiple optimizers as shown below. 
  - **SSD_train.ipynb** - Runs the training using SGD Optimizer.
  - **SSD_train_Adam.ipynb** - Runs the training using Adam Optimizer.
  - **SSD_train_RMSProp.ipynb** - Runs the training using RMSProp Optimizer.
  - **SSD_train_LearningRate.ipynb** - Runs the training using a range of *learning rates*. Used for hyperparameter tuning.
  - **SSD_train_Momentum.ipynb** - Runs the training using a range of *momentum* values. Used for hyperparameter tuning.
